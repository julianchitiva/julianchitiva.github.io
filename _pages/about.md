I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [HEC Paris](https://www.hec.edu/en/faculty-research/faculty-departments/economics-and-decision-sciences). My research interest lie in microeconomic theory, game theory and social networks. I am particularly interested in the role of information and social structures in economic dynamics. 

You can reach me by email at julian [dot] chitiva [at] hec [dot] edu

I am one of the organizers of the [Junior Parisian Game Theory Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/seminairetheoriedesjeux/junior-seminar-20242025) and the [HEC PhD Economics Conference](https://sites.google.com/view/hecon/home).
