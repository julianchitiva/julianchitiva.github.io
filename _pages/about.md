I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at [HEC Paris](https://www.hec.edu/en/faculty-research/faculty-departments/economics-and-decision-sciences). My research interest lie in microeconomic theory, game theory and social networks. I am particularly interested in the role of information and social structures in economic dynamics. Before starting my PhD I worked in consultancy developing mathematical models to solve industry and government problems in Colombia.
